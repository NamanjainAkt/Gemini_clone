## Features in Detail

### Typing Animation

The application includes a realistic typing animation that simulates the AI typing out responses in real-time. This can be toggled on or off based on user preference.

### Responsive Design

The UI adapts to different screen sizes:
- Desktop: Full sidebar and expanded controls
- Tablet: Compact sidebar and optimized card layout
- Mobile: Minimized controls and single-column layout

### Loading Indicators

Custom-designed loading indicators provide visual feedback while waiting for API responses, mimicking content placeholders for a smoother user experience.
